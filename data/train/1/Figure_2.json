    "mention":"The annotation of scientific publications requires expert knowledge of the field of research. To avoid manual annotation of the training data, we introduce a self-supervised approach by leveraging explicit inline references to figures (e.g., “Figure 2 depicts the results of the ablation experiments…”). In a scientific publication, an inline reference to a figure indicates that the paragraph and the figure are related to each other. We denote the 𝑖-th paragraph that mentions the figure 𝑥𝑗 and the set of paragraphs referring to figures in a paper as 𝑑 𝑗 𝑖 and 𝐷 = {𝑑𝑗 𝑖 ∶ 𝑖}, respectively. Instead of directly identifying a central figure during training, we learn the matching of the figure 𝑥 and the paragraph 𝑑. At training time, we make positive and negative pairs of paragraphs and figures as (𝑥𝑖 , 𝑑𝑘 𝑗 ), as shown in Figure 2. We treat the pair (𝑥𝑖 , 𝑑𝑘 𝑗 ) as positive if 𝑖 = 𝑘, while 𝑖 ≠ 𝑘 for a negative one."}
