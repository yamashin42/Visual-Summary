{"caption": "Figure 2. Graphical user interface for annotation. Paper abstract is displayed at the top to provide the overview of the research. Figures are then shown in randomly shuffled order. Annotators are asked to fill figure number of top three figures that reflect the content of abstract in the input form. The answer is recorded after clicking a “submit button” .",
    "mention":"The annotation process was conducted with a web-based tool with a graphical user interface (Figure 2), which we developed for the purpose of our study. Annotators first read a paper abstract to grasp the overview of the research. All figures extracted from the same paper are displayed below the abstract, randomly shuffled to avoid bias due to the order. After reading the abstract, annotators are asked to rank the top 3 figures as potential candidates for the GA. Majority of instances are annotated by both annotators, while limited samples are done by either of annotators, as summarized in Table 1. The inter-annotator agreement across the doubly annotated data amounts to .43 Krippendorff’s α (ordinal), which reflects the difficulty and the subjective nature of the task."}
