 "mention":"Whereas supervised machine learning requires a large amount of training data, annotating on scientific publications is expensive and time-consuming as they are highly technical texts. To overcome the difficulty in collecting training data, we introduce a self-supervised approach by leveraging explicit inline references to figures (e.g.,“Figure 2 depicts the results of the ablation experiments. . . ”), which does not require any manual effort (Figure 4). In a scientific publication, an inline204reference to a figure suggests a connection between the paragraph and the figure. We denote the set of paragraphs that mention figures asD={dji:i}where djiis ai-th paragraph that mentions the figurexj. During model training, we learn the matching problem of the figurexand the paragraphd, which results in the ability to match the text and the figure. As training data, we create positive and negative pairs where paragraphs are paired with referred and non-referred figures, respectively, i.e., we treat a pair(xi,dkj)as positive training instance ifi=kand as negative ifi6=k."}
