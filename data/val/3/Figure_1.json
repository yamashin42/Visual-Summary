    "mention": "However, in contrast to the case of PubMed papers, the ‘pick first’ baseline outperforms our Transformer based approach. This result means that the annotators tend to select figures that appear at the earlier part of a paper as top-3 figures. We then visualize the histogram of figure number to verify the annotation is biased by the order in which the figures appear (Figure 5). Whereas figures are randomly shuffled in our annotation system, and therefore annotator did not know the figure number, earlier figures tend to be ranked higher. Note again that the annotated papers contain at least five figures. For example, figure 1 is selected as rank 1 in 32:0% of annotated samples. A similar phenomenon has been observed in text summarization on the news domain: important information tends to appear in the earlier part of the article (Kryscinski et al., 2019). See et al. (2017) then exploited such bias and found that using the first 400 tokens shows better performance than using the first tokens in text summarization of news articles. Whereas Yang et al. (2019) report that using only the first figures degrades the performance in central figure identification on the PubMed data set, our findings indicate that exploiting the bias caused by the order of the figures may be beneficial in other domains, e.g., CS. We consider to explore this path in future work."}
